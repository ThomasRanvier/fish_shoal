# Fish shoal

This is a multi-agent system, it simulates a fish shoal.

There is two "modes" : 

- One with variable fish, variable sizes and speeds. 
- In the other "mode" there is big fish and little fish, the little ones are afraid of the big ones.

That type of multi-agent is usefull to expose some primary animal instincts : like forming a shoal for fish. 
In the first mode we can see that fish will form different shoals by speed. 
The second mode exposes that when some individuals in a group run from a danger the entire group follows without even knowing that there is a danger : like a flock of sheep.

You can switch mode and change main settings in the config file.

Result with the variable sizes mode. We can see that the fish make different shoals organized by their speed. The more little they are, the faster they are.

Result with the big and little mode. Here we can see that the little fish are afraid from the big ones.
